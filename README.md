Q2. The Adapter design pattern binds the client to an interface, not a concrete implementation, by providing a common interface that the client interacts with. The adapter acts as a bridge between the client and the concrete implementation, translating the interface of the implementation into the target interface expected by the client. This decouples the client from the specific implementation details and allows for flexibility in using different implementations that conform to the target interface.
